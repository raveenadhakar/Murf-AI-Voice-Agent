# 🏴‍☠️ Captain AI's Parrot - Setup Complete!

## What We've Built

You now have a complete **conversational AI voice assistant** with a swashbuckling pirate personality! Here's what's been implemented:

### ✅ Core Features Implemented

1. **🎤 Voice Recognition**: Browser-based speech recognition (reliable, no API needed)
2. **🏴‍☠️ Pirate AI Persona**: Custom Gemini-powered AI with authentic pirate personality
3. **🎵 Text-to-Speech**: Multiple TTS options with browser fallback
4. **💬 Chat History**: Conversation memory for natural dialogue
5. **🌊 Real-time Streaming**: Live audio streaming and response generation
6. **📱 Responsive UI**: Modern pirate-themed interface

### 🔧 Technical Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI with WebSocket streaming
- **AI Model**: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash (with pirate persona)
- **Speech Recognition**: Browser Web Speech API (works reliably)
- **TTS**: OpenAI/ElevenLabs/Murf with browser fallback
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with modern CSS

### 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set up your API key** (create `.env` file):
   ```env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Open browser**: Go to `http://localhost:8000`

### 🎯 How It Works

1. **User clicks microphone** → Browser speech recognition starts
2. **User speaks** → Real-time transcription appears
3. **User stops talking** → Transcript sent to Gemini AI with pirate persona
4. **AI responds** → Streaming pirate response with personality
5. **TTS converts response** → Audio plays back to user
6. **Conversation continues** → Chat history maintained for context

### 🏴‍☠️ Pirate Features

- **Authentic pirate language**: "Ahoy!", "Arrr!", "matey", "ye", etc.
- **Sea-themed responses**: Maritime metaphors and references
- **Conversational memory**: Remembers previous exchanges
- **Helpful personality**: Knowledgeable but fun pirate character

### 🔑 API Keys Needed

**Required**:
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Get from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

**Optional** (for better TTS):
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: For high-quality voice synthesis
- `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`: For premium voice options
- `MURF_API_KEY`: Alternative TTS service

### 🧪 Testing

Run the test script to verify everything works:
```bash
python test_pirate.py
```
